% A bare, sample template for a Yale PhD thesis using yalephd.cls
% This one has been modified from the original version, in order to break up the content
% into multiple files that get inserted into the main one.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass[letterpaper,12pt]{yalephd}
% remove draft option for final printing.
% font size must be between 10pt-12pt.

\usepackage{geometry} % you need this for yalephd.cls to work.
\usepackage{graphicx} % you probably want the rest of these.
\setkeys{Gin}{draft=false} % with this, basically all that the draft option does is add a header
\usepackage{dcolumn}
\usepackage{bm}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{appendix}
\usepackage{comment}
% If you're using BibLaTeX, you can't use the cite package, so comment it out (it's incompatible, but also redundant)
\usepackage{cite}
\usepackage{notoccite}
\usepackage[draft=false]{hyperref} % always generates hyperlinks, even in draft mode
\usepackage{cleveref}
% subcaption makes the hyperlinks to figures and such go to the top of the float, not the top of the caption.
% I assume it does other stuff as well, but that's why I used it.
\usepackage{subcaption}

% bibliography style if you're using BibTeX. Comment this out if using BibLaTeX!
\bibliographystyle{abbrvunsrt}

%% Load BibLaTeX if you're using it. These style options are similar to Physical Review Letters style,
%% but somewhat more verbose (titles are included, for instance).
%\usepackage[
%    backend=biber,
%    style=phys,
%    biblabel=brackets,
%    eprint=true
%]{biblatex}
%% If using BibLaTeX, you need to load your bibliography file in the preamble
%\addbibresource{name_of_your_bibtex_file.bib}

% This lets you put your figures in subfolders and then insert them without having to use the full path.
% It's useful, for instance, to put each chapter's figures in a separate folder.
\graphicspath{ {./figures/} }

\include{definitions}
% One space after periods, not two
\frenchspacing

% Need to define title before the abstract.
\title{Title goes here}
\author{Your name}
\advisor{Your advisor's name}
\date{Month, year you'll receive your degree, like ``May, 2015''} % usually not \today.

% This structure lets you remove parts of the document without changing the overall structure.
% So, if you comment out everything but chapter 2, the only material in the main text you get is
% chapter 2, but the page numbers, TOC, etc are all still correct. Useful for working on one part
% at a time.
\includeonly{
definitions,
content/1-introduction,
content/2-newchapter,
content/A-stuff,
content/B-morestuff
}

\begin{document}

% All the stuff at the front of your thesis.
\frontmatter

\begin{abstract}
	\input{content/0-abstract.tex} % loads the abstract from a different file
	% this one uses \input bc it's just pasting text, but the chapters will use \include
\end{abstract}

\maketitle
\makecopyright{\printyear} % \printyear was populated from the \date{} entry already
\tableofcontents
\listoffigures % remove this if you have no figures.
\listoftables % remove this if you have no tables.


\chapter{Acknowledgements} % this needs to be before \mainmatter.
A lot of people are awesome. Probably your family, friends, 
advisor, and that one super special high school teacher who
believed in you.

% Starts proper arabic numbering of pages and chapters.
\mainmatter

%% Include your chapters here
\include{content/1-introduction}

\include{content/2-newchapter}


% once you're finished your main chapters, on to the appendices
% Only call appendix once, here.
\appendix

\include{content/A-stuff}

\include{content/B-morestuff}

% Any chapters such as End Notes go after this.
\backmatter

% for your own sake, use a bibtex file, so all of the numbering of references will be done
% automatically. BibTeX version:
\bibliography{name_of_your_bibtex_file}
% BibLaTeX version:
%\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
