This Github Repository is for a latex template and class file for a PhD dissertation at Yale University.

## Using LaTeX

Simply modify the `yale_thesis_alt.tex` document as necessary. `yale_thesis.tex` is roughly equivalent, but it doesn't use the distributed file structure. It's harder to edit a dissertation when it's all in one giant file, so I recommend using `yale_thesis_alt.tex`.

## Using LyX

The LyX stuff is old; I (RLB) don't use LyX, so I never tried to get it to work. I have no idea if it works, and it may not look the same as the "normal" LaTeX version. Original instructions:

Run `bash linker.sh`, or use the commands in it to do it yourself. Use `thesis.lyx` as a template.
