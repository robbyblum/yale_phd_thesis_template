\mainmatter

\chapter{Introduction} \label{chapter1}
Your first chapter is probably an introduction. But who knows. Check out Eq.\ (\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})!
Note that after Eq.\ and Fig.\ you want to use `.\textbackslash'  to use a single sized space. Otherwise,
latex will interpret it as the end of a sentence and put additional white space in between `Eq.' and 
`(\ref{that_right_triangle_rule})'.
Actually, you might want to input a tilde (\texttt{\~}) (a non-breaking space) instead of a space, so that the `Eq.' and number don't break across a line.
Or you could use commands from \texttt{hyperref} or \texttt{cleveref}.
See \cref{chapter2} for that...

By the way, I strongly recommend splitting up your paragraphs so that you have each sentence on its own line.
This makes the diffs much easier to read, which makes version control more useful.

\begin{equation}
a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \label{that_right_triangle_rule}
\end{equation}

The Physics Department recommends that the first chapter of the thesis be 
a succinct summary of the entire thesis, including in particular:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item a brief review of the field prior to the thesis research to provide context
  \item a presentation of the goals and motivations of the thesis research 
  \item a clear description of what the student has achieved in the thesis research
 (primarily written in the first person singular, but with due credit to
 others as appropriate). This description should refer back to (1) and clearly indicate the relation
 to prior work.
\end{enumerate}
It may also make sense to add suggestions for how to best build upon the thesis research in future work. Otherwise these suggestions should appear in the conclusion of the thesis.


\chapter{A new chapter} \label{chapter2}
Your second chapter probably has novel material in it. Hopefully. Here's a math object written using a shortcut that I defined in a separate file: $\Pzero$.

% Add additional \chapter{}s as necessary.

% use \cite{} to cite a reference in your bibliography file.
% use \ref{} to reference a \label{} from an equation, figure, or table.

% for sets of equations use align or gather:
%\begin{align}
%\end{align}

% for long equations, use multline.

% for figures:
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.45\textwidth]{name_of_figure.pdf}
\caption[Short caption for the list of figures]{A figure caption!}
\label{a_figure}
\end{figure}

More material. Very exciting! Take a look at this reference to Figure~\ref{a_figure}.
Alternatively, you might want to use the \texttt{cleveref} package, which would give you this: \cref{a_figure}.
Or, you could use \texttt{hyperref}'s \texttt{autoref} command: \autoref{a_figure}.
I think that \texttt{cleveref} is the best of these options, because it lets you do multiple references gracefully and consistently: \cref{a_figure,a_table}.
\Cref{a_figure} can also be cited at the start of a sentence using \texttt{Cref} instead of \texttt{cref}; note the different result.

% for tables:
\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 1 & 2 & 3 \\
 4 & 5 & 6 \\
 7 & 8 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption[Short caption for the list of tables]{Another caption! This one is for a table, not a figure.}
\label{a_table}
\end{table}


% once you're finished your main chapters, on to the appendices
% Only call appendix once, here.
\appendix

\chapter{Stuff}
If you need an appendix, it will go here.

\begin{align}
a^n + b^n &\ne c^n \\
n &> 2
\end{align}

\chapter{More stuff}
A second appendix. Look at you, you over achiever.

% Any chapters such as End Notes go after this.
\backmatter

% for your own sake, use a bibtex file, so all of the numbering of references will be done
% automatically. BibTeX version:
\bibliography{name_of_your_bibtex_file}
% BibLaTeX version:
%\printbibliography[heading=bibintoc]
